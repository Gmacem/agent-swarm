# Fetch Task

Claim the next available task from the backlog.

## Instructions

1. Read `tasks/backlog.md` and look for the highest-priority unclaimed task.
2. If the backlog is empty, check `tasks/active/` for any tasks that are blocked and might need re-assignment.
3. When you find a task to claim:
   - Move it from `tasks/backlog.md` to a new file in `tasks/active/TASK-<id>.md`.
   - Set the status to `in-progress`.
   - Set the assigned role to your role.
   - Set the updated date to today.
4. Report which task you claimed and its key details.

If there are no tasks available, report that the backlog is empty and suggest checking with the Coordinator.
